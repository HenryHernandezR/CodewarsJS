You get any card as an argument. Your task is to return the suit of this card (in lowercase).

Our deck (is preloaded):

('3♣') -> return 'clubs'
('3♦') -> return 'diamonds'
('3♥') -> return 'hearts'
('3♠') -> return 'spades'


Create a function 'defineSuit' that accepts one parameter '(card)'
create a variable 'suit' that equals to the card parameter and substracts the first character of the string. (only the symbol is needed)
create a switch function to evaluate the suit variable. The switch function will match the suit variable against a series of case
creat a case function for each card  and have it return a string matching the the symbol in lowercase.

after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.
add Breaks and default clause.
