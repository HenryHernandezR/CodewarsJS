create a  function that takes two parameters 
 -the functions goal is to return a new list or array containing the first 'n' elements from the original list or array
 -accept parameters, the function should take two parameters: the list or array and the number 'n'
 -return a new list/array, the function needs to create and return a new list or array/
 -extracting elements, the new list should contain the first 'n' elements from the original list or array.
 -handling special cases, if the original list or array has fewer than 'n' elements, the function should still return as many elemnets as possible.
create a new empty array, this is where the new list will be returned
use a loop to iterate through the elements of the original array.
for each iteration, check if youve reached the desired number 'n'
if not, add the current element to the new array.
after the loop, return the new array.
